# Egeria Palisade integration

Egeria Palisade provides the Apache 2.0 licensed integration between Palisade and Egeria.  
This readme will be split into 2 parts, one focusing on [Egeria](https://github.com/odpi/egeria), and the other, [Palisade](https://github.com/gchq/Palisade). We will cover how to start both services and run through a demo to collect metadata, and redact or mask information based on users context and purpose.  

## Egeria

## Palisade
<p>First things first we need to build Palisade and the Egeria-Palisade 
Repository which requires a clone of the Palisade repository in the same folder as this repository.
